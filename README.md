# Painter algorithm
- It's slow
- It's retro
- It has some limitations
- It's good

Dixit Wikipedia:
The painter's algorithm (also depth-sort algorithm and priority fill) is an algorithm for visible surface determination in 3D computer graphics that works on a polygon-by-polygon basis rather than a pixel-by-pixel, row by row, or area by area basis of other Hidden-Surface Removal algorithms. The algorithm can fail in some cases, including cyclic overlap or piercing polygons.
